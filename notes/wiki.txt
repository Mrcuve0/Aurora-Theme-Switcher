## Why LightHouse Theme Switcher?

Since I spend most of my day in front of my laptop screen (for study/work but also for leisure), I have always had the need to try to relieve the strain on my eyes. 

Of course all the medical advice to take regular breaks is valid and worth way to alleviate the issue. But why not also act directly on the cause of the problem?

During the day I prefer a light theme (my screens are all opaque and often close to a window or a light source, making it unsuitable for dark themes). In the evening, on the other hand, the advantages of a dark theme are obvious: less visual fatigue and, above all, easier to fall asleep.

Hence, observing my habits, I discovered that every day, always at about the same time in the evening, I switched from my [Aritim-Light theme](https://github.com/Mrcuve0/Aritim-Light) to my [Aritim-Dark theme](https://github.com/Mrcuve0/Aritim-Dark)).
Considering that every time I had to go to `System Settings` and change all the settings, I asked myself: why not automate the whole process?

## So, LightHouse can switch automatically your theme on KDE Plasma?

Exactly. Obviously to do this you need to have two different themes that you would like to see applied during your day. You can download them from the `System Settings` or from the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org). They don't necessarily have to match (light and dark), you can choose what you want to apply, according to your preferences, of course.

## Is there anything else LightHouse can do?

Since I am strictly convinced that a good theme should be accompanied by an equally good wallpaper, LightHouse can automatically change wallpaper according to your preferences. 
Maybe you have a lighter wallpaper that you would prefer to use in the morning and a darker wallpaper to use in the evening. That's why LightHouse is here.

In addition to this, LightHouse also allows you to change the theme of Konsole, also adapting it to the time of your day. 

Last but not least, since so many Linux programs are based on GTK graphics libraries, I thought it was right to change the theme of these applications as well.

Simply put, no one is excluded!
